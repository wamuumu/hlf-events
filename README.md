### 🔗 Network Operations

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All scripts related to network operations must be executed from the `network/scripts/` directory. Furthermore, please refer to the [Script Reference](#-script-reference) section for detailed information about each script and its parameters.

> [!NOTE]  
> In a production environment, network federated operations might be a little tricky since they often require strict cooperation and coordination among all the network members.

### 📦 Initial Network Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Before proceeding, a leader organization should be chosen, ensuring critical operations are executed only once.

#### Requirements Installation

```bash
# Install Hyperledger Fabric binaries and dependencies
cd network/scripts
./install-requirements.sh
```

> [!WARNING]  
> After the above operation, please ensure that Hyperledger Fabric binaries are available under the `network/bin` folder.

#### Cryptographic Material Generation

Each organization must generate its own credentials (private keys and public certificates) using the provided configuration files. This increases security by ensuring private keys are never shared, while public certificates are distributed via the shared `network/identities` folder.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Generate cryptographic material for each organization
./network-prep.sh <crypto-config-file> <docker-compose-file>
```
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crypto config files and docker compose files should be distributed by the **leader organization** and adjusted accordingly.

#### Genesis Block Generation

The leader organization is responsible for **generating** and **distributing** the genesis block. This block is saved under the `network/channel` directory and it is mainly used for channel creation and organization joining.

```bash
# 2️⃣ Generate genesis block (leader only)
./network-init.sh
```

> [!CAUTION]  
> In production environments, `network/identities` and `network/channel` directories must be shared among all organizations.

#### Containers startup and channel joining

After all organizations have generated their credentials and the genesis block has been distributed, each organization can start its Docker containers and join the channel.

```bash
# 3️⃣ Start Docker containers
./docker-up.sh <docker-compose-file>

# 4️⃣ Join orderers and organizations to the channel

# If this is an orderer organization:
./network-join-orderer.sh <orderer-hostname>

# If this is a regular organization:
./network-join-organization.sh <org-domain>
```

> [!TIP]  
> Orderers and peers have different roles: **peers** execute chaincodes, maintain a copy of the channel ledger and host the world state, while **orderers** are responsible for ordering transactions into blocks and ensuring consistency across the network.

### 🔑 Chaincode Lifecycle

The chaincode defines the business logic of the blockchain application that runs on the peer nodes. 

#### Chaincode Installation

Chaincode source code and metadata are bundled into a single file, typically a tarball, with a unique **package ID**. This package is the deployable unit that gets installed on the peers of each organization.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Package the chaincode 
./chaincode-package.sh

# 2️⃣ Install chaincode on organization's peers
./chaincode-install.sh <org-domain>
```

#### Chaincode Approval

Once the chaincode is installed, each organization must formally approve its definition (e.g. name, version and endorsement policies) for the channel. This ensures that all the members of the federation agree on the same chaincode.

```bash
# 3️⃣ Approve chaincode (each organization)
./chaincode-approve.sh <org-domain>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For this project, in order to reach consensus, all the organizations must approve the chaincode definition.

#### Chaincode Commitment

After all organizations have approved the chaincode, it can be **committed** to the channel. This makes the chaincode active and ready to execute invoke and query transactions.

```bash
# 4️⃣ Commit chaincode to channel (only once)
./chaincode-commit.sh <org-domain>

# 5️⃣ Test chaincode operations (optional)
./chaincode-invoke.sh <org-domain> <peer-id>
./chaincode-query.sh <org-domain> <peer-id>
```

### 🔄 Dynamic Organization Management

The network supports dynamic addition and removal of organizations without requiring a complete network restart. This is achieved through configuration updates and channel reconfiguration.

#### Adding a New Organization

> [!NOTE]  
> In the following example, the [Basic Setup](#-basic-setup) with 3 organizations is extended by adding a 4th organization (`org4.testbed.local`).

Initially, the new organization must generate its cryptographic material and start its Docker containers, as the other organizations did during the initial setup. Its public certificates must also be shared via the `network/identities` folder.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Org 4: Generate credentials
./network-prep.sh crypto-config-org4.yaml docker-compose-org4.yaml

# 2️⃣ Org 4: Start containers
./docker-up.sh docker-compose-org4.yaml
```

Then, an existing organization (e.g. `org1.testbed.local`) must generate a join request to add the new organization to the channel. This request is saved as a configuration update proposal in the file `org4_update_in_envelope.pb`, located by default under the shared `network/channel` directory. All existing network members must approve this proposal before it can be committed and the new organization becomes an official channel member.

```bash
# 3️⃣ Existing org (e.g. org1.testbed.local): Create join request
./network-join-request.sh configtx-org4.yaml org1.testbed.local

# 4️⃣ All orgs: Approve join request
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org1.testbed.local
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org2.testbed.local
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org3.testbed.local

# 5️⃣ Existing org (e.g. org1.testbed.local): Commit update
./network-commit-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org1.testbed.local
```

At this point, the new organization has been successfully added to the channel. As with the existing members, it can now have its peer(s) join the channel and set its anchor peer.

The **anchor peer** allows peer discovery and cross-organization communication within the channel via the gossip protocol.

> [!NOTE]  
> This step is required now because the new organization was not part of the channel when the original members set their anchor peers.

```bash
# 6️⃣ Org 4: Join channel and set anchor peer
./network-join-organization.sh org4.testbed.local
./network-set-anchor-peer.sh org4.testbed.local 1
```

Finally, the chaincode must be installed on the new organization’s peer(s), approved and then committed once again on the channel.

> [!CAUTION]  
> After the new organization has joined the channel, all the federation members must approve the chaincode definition again to include the new member.

```bash
# 7️⃣ Org 4: Install the chaincode
./chaincode-install.sh org4.testbed.local

# All orgs (including org4): Approve the chaincode again
./chaincode-approve.sh org1.testbed.local 
./chaincode-approve.sh org2.testbed.local 
./chaincode-approve.sh org3.testbed.local 
./chaincode-approve.sh org4.testbed.local 

# Existing org: Commit the chaincode again (only once)
./chaincode-commit.sh org1.testbed.local 
```

#### Removing an Existing Organization

As for adding a new organization, the removal process is almost the same, but in reverse order. An existing organization (e.g. `org1.testbed.local`) must create a leave request for the organization to be removed (e.g. `org4.testbed.local`). This request must then be approved by the majority of the other members before it can be committed.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Create leave request
./network-leave-request.sh configtx-org4.yaml org1.testbed.local

# 2️⃣ Approve removal (majority required)
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org1.testbed.local
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org2.testbed.local
./network-approve-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org3.testbed.local

# 3️⃣ Commit removal
./network-commit-update.sh org4_update_in_envelope.pb org1.testbed.local

# 4️⃣ Leaving org: Clean up credentials and stop containers
./network-leave-organization.sh org4.testbed.local --hard
./docker-down.sh docker-compose-org4.yaml
```

---

### 🖧 Basic Setup

```bash
# Setup a ready-to-use network with 3 organizations and 3 orderers
./test-3-orgs.sh
```

In this scenario, three peer organizations (`R1, R2, R3`) and three ordering organizations (`R4, R5, R6`) have jointly decided that they will establish a network. This network has a configuration, `CC1`, which all of the organizations have agreed to and which lists the definition of the organizations as well as the policies which define the roles each organization will play on the channel (i.e. `configtx.yaml` file).

On this channel, R1, R2 and R3 will join peers, named P1, P2 and P3, to the **channel** `mychannel`, while R4, R5 and R6 owns respectively O1, O2 and O3, the ordering services of the channel. All of these nodes will contain a copy of the **ledger** (`L1`) of the channel, which is where transactions are recorded.

In this example, the chaincode `cc-test` has been installed on every peer.

> [!NOTE]  
> Ordering services don’t have the chaincode installed on them, as ordering nodes don’t propose transactions.

### 🧿 Security Considerations

- 🔐 **Private keys** are stored locally in the `network/organizations` directory (never shared)
- 📜 **Public certificates** are shared via the `network/identities` folder (ensure trust)
- 🔏 **TLS enabled** for all communications
- ✍️ **Digital signatures** are used for identity verification. For each operation, a challenge is created to test if there is a match between the private credentials and the shared public certificate (useful in local development setups)
- 🎫 **MSP-based** access control

---

### 💡 Troubleshooting

> #### 1. Docker containers fail to start due to volume related issues

In this specific setup, the Docker Compose files assume directories like `/data_hlf1/fabric/...` to exist (as on the university server). 

**Solutions (choose one):**

1. **Modify the Compose files**

    Remove the user binding (1000:988) from each service and change the volume definitions to let Docker manage them:

```yaml
# In docker-compose-ord1.yaml
volumes:
    orderer_ord1_data:
        driver: local

# Do the same for the other compose files...
```

2. **Create the required directories locally**

    Manually create the directories and set ownership to match the Compose configuration:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data_hlf1/fabric/orderer_ord1_data
sudo mkdir -p /data_hlf1/fabric/peer0_org1_data
# create also the other required directories...

sudo chown -R 1000:988 /data_hlf1/fabric/
``` 

After applying **either solution**, you can run the network using:

```bash
./test-3-orgs.sh
```
